# Can Draft Combine Data Predict the Next NBA Superstar?
Joshua Lim - chaelim@umich.edu

## Introduction

The National Basketball Association or the NBA is a beloved league watched by millions. The NBA offers high-level basketball and superstars to provide sports entertainment for fans. Over decades of professional basketball history, many superstars have emerged where some were initially underrated and overlooked. For instance, Stephen Curry or Nikola Jokic. This project explores whether we can predict a player's performance in the NBA using data from the NBA Draft Combine. The dataset includes physical measurements, athletic drill results, college attended, and career statistics for players active as of June 2025.

### üìå Project Question

**Can we predict a player's professional performance measured by Player Efficiency Rating (PER) using college name and Draft Combine physical and athletic data?**

This question is useful because PER is a well-known, single-number summary of a player's performance. If teams could reliably predict PER using only combine and college data, they could make more data-driven draft decisions ‚Äî potentially reducing costly draft busts. For the average basketball fan, a working model can spotlight which rookies to watch, making it easier to follow their exciting growth into superstars.
